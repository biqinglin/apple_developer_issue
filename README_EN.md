I'm an iOS developer currently based in Shanghai, China, I've been trying to design and develop my own products independently in my spare time since 2017, I've released 6 apps so far and all of my products are exclusive to the iOS platform!

It's Saturday, 11.6, 2020, and I'm sitting at my computer at 8:00 a.m., as usual, and I'm updating the [Travel Diary] (App ID: 1440237237) app, and at 10:29 a.m., I get a Notice of Termination from Apple, informing me that my developer account is in violation of the Section 3.2(f) of the ADP Agreement was permanently deleted and all the apps were removed, I was confused, I thought I had sent the wrong email, I hurriedly tried to log into the developer's backend and found that my account had indeed been deleted, I was helpless and confused, I had no idea what regulations I had violated, this result is unacceptable to me, I started with the Since 2017, I started to embark on this path of iOS development until today, I have always strictly abided by the platform rules, even if the occasional application is rejected, I also cooperate with the reasons for rejection to actively adjust, so for this time my developer program was terminated, I hope to get a reasonable explanation, I hope you can help me forward the following to introduce my application.

1.In April 2017, I independently designed and developed [Moshi Weather] (App ID: 1228179247), with the kawaii font style, it shows the detailed weather parameters for today and the next 5 days.

2.In May 2017, I launched [Occupy Box] (App ID: 1228559683), which uses interesting algorithm rules to color all the boxes to win.

3.November 2017, I independently designed, developed and shelved a light social application [small private] (App ID: 1249902405), which is an anonymous sharing of your little secret application, where all are anonymous, no one will know your identity, because the application is light social, there will be user-generated content, and I am a spare time to do maintenance updates, time The energy was not available, so I manually removed it from the App Store in April 2019.

4.In May 2018, after learning the development language released by Apple at the time: swift, combined with my own needs, over a period of 5 months to independently design and develop this [share of money ledger] (App ID: 1244522074), and on the App Store, with other accounting software is very different, this application specializes in record management Chinese unique The human share of the money, simply record the received and sent share of the money, with the human relationship system, statistics, synchronization, export and other rich application features to meet user needs. The application has been online for more than two years, I have been in the maintenance and updating, the number of application iterations more than 50 times, the cumulative number of registered users more than 50,000, the product reputation has been very good, the following excerpts part of the user reviews.

"The original are in the memo, have been looking for a software like this, this is really quite easy to use after the updated version of the function is more and more complete, the most important thing is that the lady after-sales service is very good, do not understand the function to teach me friends! Awesome!" (a).
"I accidentally imported icloud twice, causing confusion in my list, added contact information of the person who pushed to the system and patiently helped me with the problem, kudos".
"Very useful software, if you have a problem, reflect it to the developer and it will be solved immediately! That's awesome üëçüëç".
"It's not bloated with features and it really works!"

5. in December 2018, I developed [Check-In Box] (App ID: 1439392904), which is a collection tool for those apps in your phone that you need to check in every day, so that you will no longer forget to check in and miss check-ins. But the app was removed from the market when I updated it on 2019.9.19 for violating the moderation regulations, i.e. "cannot display third-party apps", and I have since abandoned the app, leaving it to languish in the background. The app was taken down for over a year and I left it there untouched, but in September of this year, I tried to redesign and submit the update and it was still rejected for the same reason, then I tried to ask for a phone call from an audit representative, and a few days later a male auditor called and informed me that there was no way the app could be reviewed and that the app usage scenario did not comply with Apple's review regulations! I was asked to abandon the update, which I understood at the time, so after that I abandoned the app completely and left it on hold in the developer's background.

6. In March 2020, I launched my sixth personal app: [Travel Diary] (App ID: 1440237237), which is a simple travel diary app to save your travel memories through photos and journals. I spent more than a year of spare time to develop this application based on this reservation. The same I used the latest Swift5 for development, using iCloud to achieve cloud storage of user data and multi-device synchronization capabilities, the application on line for many times Apple editor recommended to the fresh App list, Today tasted fresh, today's theme and other boards, many users favored, the following excerpts part of the user reviews.

"You can record good memories during your travels, and it's hype recommended. You can save text, and pictures. It also supports export function".
"A little artsy, clean and refreshing interface reminiscent of a summer breeze by the sea ......".
On the road to iOS development, I've kept learning Apple's cutting-edge technologies and using them appropriately in my products, the two apps I'm currently maintaining [Penny Book] (App ID: 1244522074) and [Travel Diary] (App ID: 1440237237) are both based on Swift5+UIKit development. Although I'm not a full-time developer, I keep working every day when I come back from work and every weekend to continuously polish and improve the product features and experience to meet the needs of users and provide better service to them.
